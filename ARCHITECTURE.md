## 1. High-Level Overview

Becket is a **local intelligence layer** for codebases. It ingests a repository, builds a
deterministic structural model (symbols, dependencies, flows, entry points), compiles a **grounded
knowledge wiki** on top of it, persists both as a versioned, machine-readable store, and exposes them
to humans and AI agents through three surfaces:

1. A **CLI** (`becket build | impact | flow | context | wiki`).
2. A set of **versioned artifacts** under `.becket/` (JSON graph + `wiki/*.md`).
3. An **MCP server** (`becket-mcp`) speaking JSON-RPC over stdio.

Conceptually there are **three knowledge layers**, in increasing abstraction:

| Layer | Owner | Answers | Persistence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Deterministic Core** | Becket (code-derived) | *What is true?* (symbols, edges, flows, impact) | JSON + SQLite, byte-identical rebuilds |
| **Knowledge Layer (Repo Wiki)** | Host LLM, **grounded by the core** | *What does it mean? Why? Gotchas?* | `.becket/wiki/*.md`, compounding |
| **Context Assembly** | Becket (retrieval) | *What code + knowledge do I need now?* | computed per query, within a token budget |

The core verifies the wiki (grounding + lint), and the wiki + core + raw source feed Context Assembly.

The system is organized in layers, each with a single responsibility and a stable internal contract:

**Design tenets enforced by this structure**
- The **Deterministic Core never touches the network**. Reproducibility and privacy are structural, not configurable.
- The **AI-Augmentation Layer is strictly additive**: removing it degrades quality (fewer human-friendly names/summaries, no wiki prose) but never breaks structural correctness.
- The **Knowledge Layer is grounded and verifiable**: every wiki page anchors to symbol ids from the core, and `wiki lint` re-checks page claims against the live graph. The graph is always the tie-breaker; on conflict, the page is flagged stale, never the graph.
- **Context Assembly never invents code**: snippets are sliced from the real source on disk; only prose (wiki) can be model-authored.
- The **artifacts (`.becket/*.json` + `.becket/wiki/*.md`) are the public contract**; the index DB is an internal, rebuildable cache.

## 2. Tech Stack

The driving requirements — support **every language possible**, scale from **tiny to truly enormous**
repos, deliver the **lowest possible latency**, and pick the **best technology regardless of team
size** — point decisively to a **Rust-first** implementation. Rust gives native speed, predictable
low-latency memory behavior (no GC pauses on huge graphs), fearless parallelism, and single-binary
distribution, while still integrating cleanly with the AI ecosystem.

### Chosen stack

| Layer | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Core, CLI & MCP server** | **Rust** (CLI via `clap`, MCP via the official **Rust MCP SDK** / `rmcp`) | One language end-to-end; native performance for the small→huge range; lowest latency; single static binary, easy distribution. |
| **Parsing** | **tree-sitter** (native Rust bindings) | Incremental, error-tolerant parsers for dozens of languages; the de-facto standard for multi-language tooling; deterministic. |
| **Language support** | **Plugin model** — one grammar + extraction ruleset per language, loaded from a registry | "As many languages as possible" without a monolith; community can add languages; ships a curated core set first. |
| **Index / Memory DB** | **SQLite** (`rusqlite`) with **recursive CTEs** for graph traversal | Embedded, zero-config, transactional, extremely fast locally; recursive CTEs cover impact/flow traversal. |
| **Vector store** | **`sqlite-vec`** (same SQLite file) | Single embedded file, no extra service; aligns with local-first. |
| **Embeddings** | **Bundled local ONNX model** via `ort` (+ `fastembed-rs`), small (e.g. BGE-small, ~100 MB) | The *only* model Becket ships. Runs in-process, offline, deterministic — **not** a server/daemon and **not** Ollama. Downloaded once on first build, then cached. License verified Apache-2.0/MIT. |
| **LLM text enrichment** | **Exclusively host-delegated via MCP sampling** (Cursor / Claude Code / Codex model) | No bundled LLM, **no Ollama, no remote provider, no API keys**. If no MCP host is present, text enrichment is simply skipped — deterministic output is unaffected. |
| **Artifact schemas** | **JSON Schema** + generated types, explicit `schemaVersion` | Output is a versioned public contract; schemas are testable and self-documenting. |
| **Distribution** | **Native signed binaries** via `cargo-dist` (GitHub Releases) + a **thin npm wrapper** (`npx becket`) that fetches the right binary | Primary install path for users; shell installer on Releases as fallback. Contributors build from a clone. |

> **Graph storage note:** we start with SQLite + recursive CTEs (simplest, fully embedded). If traversal
> depth/latency on enormous monorepos becomes a bottleneck, an embedded graph engine
> (e.g. **KùzuDB**, Cypher) is the pre-vetted upgrade path — same local-first footprint.

### How AI works (final decision)
Becket uses **two clearly separated kinds of "AI", and never bundles an LLM**:

1. **Embeddings (local, deterministic):** a single small ONNX model runs in-process to vectorize
   symbols for semantic search. This is an index, not a chatbot — no daemon, no Ollama, no network.
2. **LLM text generation (host-delegated only):** human-friendly domain names and summaries are
   produced **exclusively via MCP sampling** — i.e. the model already running in the host agent
   (Cursor, Claude Code, Codex). Becket holds **no keys, no Ollama, no remote provider**.

**Enrichment is opportunistic & lazy.** `becket build` always produces the full deterministic
structure (and embeddings) with **no model required**. LLM naming/summaries are computed **on demand**
the first time a symbol/flow is accessed through an MCP host that supports sampling, then **cached** in
the store so the cost is paid once. Without a host model, Becket falls back to deterministic names
(module/folder/symbol-derived) — fully functional, just less prose.

### Explicitly *not* needed
No managed cloud database, no Kubernetes, no always-on web backend, **no team-sync / cloud component**,
**no telemetry**. The product is strictly local.

## 3. System Architecture

### 3.1 Build pipeline (data flow on `becket build`)

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["Walk files\n(respect .becketignore)"] --> B["Hash files\n(content + mtime)"]
    B --> C{"Changed\nsince last run?"}
    C -- "no" --> R["Reuse cached\nparse/graph"]
    C -- "yes" --> D["Parse with tree-sitter"]
    D --> E["Extract symbols\n(funcs, classes, methods, vars)"]
    E --> F["Resolve references\n(imports/calls/extends)"]
    F --> X["Cross-repo link\n(service contracts)"]
    X --> G["Build graphs\nsymbol / dependency / call"]
    R --> G
    G --> H["Reconstruct flows\n+ detect entry points"]
    H --> EMB2["Embeddings (local ONNX)\n+ deterministic names"]
    EMB2 --> J["Persist to Index DB"]
    J --> K["Emit versioned JSON\n.becket/*.json"]
    J -. "lazy, on query via MCP host" .-> LLM["LLM names/summaries\n(MCP sampling) → cached"]
```

> Note: `build` never needs a model. LLM-authored names/summaries are filled in **lazily** the first
> time an MCP host with sampling accesses them, then cached.

### 3.2 Query path (e.g. agent calls `get_impact`)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Agent as AI Agent
    participant MCP as becket-mcp (stdio)
    participant Q as Query Engine
    participant DB as Index DB (SQLite + vec)

    Agent->>MCP: get_impact { symbol: "UserService" }
    MCP->>Q: resolve symbol id
    Q->>DB: recursive traversal (downstream edges)
    DB-->>Q: affected modules, dependents, related tests
    Q->>DB: vector lookup (related concepts)
    DB-->>Q: semantic neighbors
    Q-->>MCP: compact, ranked impact set
    MCP-->>Agent: JSON (token-optimized)
```

### 3.3 Component responsibilities

- **Ingestion & Walker** — discovers files, applies ignore rules, computes content hashes for incremental builds.
- **Parser** — tree-sitter per language; tolerant to syntax errors; emits normalized AST/CST nodes.
- **Resolver** — links references across files (imports, calls, inheritance), producing typed edges.
- **Cross-repo Linker** — links symbols *across repos* in a workspace via service contracts (HTTP/gRPC client↔server, shared package names, OpenAPI/proto, message-queue topics). See §3.4.
- **Graph Builder** — materializes three logical graphs (symbol graph, dependency graph, call graph).
- **Flow Reconstructor** — stitches call/data paths into business flows; flags external-system & cross-repo boundaries.
- **Impact Engine** — forward/backward reachability over edges; correlates tests and risk zones; traverses across repos.
- **AI-Augmentation** — embeddings + optional LLM naming/summarization (via MCP sampling); always reversible and additive.
- **Knowledge Layer (Repo Wiki)** — compiles persistent markdown pages (module/service/flow/concept) from the graph, authored lazily via MCP sampling, with each page anchored to symbol ids. See §3.5.
- **Wiki Lint** — re-validates pages against the current graph: flags stale claims, contradictions, orphan pages, and broken cross-links. The graph is ground truth. See §3.5.
- **Context Assembly** — builds a per-query bundle (code snippets + relevant wiki + impact set) packed within a token budget. Slices real source; never fabricates code. See §3.6.
- **Repository Memory** — SQLite index (rebuildable cache) + JSON artifacts + wiki markdown (stable, versioned output).
- **Access Surfaces** — CLI and MCP server share one Query Engine; no logic is duplicated.

### 3.4 Multi-repo / workspace model

A **workspace** is a manifest listing one or more local repositories that belong to the same logical
project (e.g. several microservices). Analysis runs per-repo (so each repo keeps its own `.becket/`),
then the **Cross-repo Linker** stitches a unified graph using deterministic **service contracts**:

- HTTP/REST: match client call sites (URL + verb) to server route declarations.
- gRPC / Protobuf & OpenAPI: shared service/message definitions resolve client↔server edges.
- Messaging: producers/consumers matched by topic/queue name.
- Shared libraries: same package coordinates across repos.

Cross-repo edges are tagged `boundary = network|queue|shared-lib` and `confidence` (since dynamic
endpoints are inferred). This lets `flow payment` span repos and `impact` propagate across service
boundaries. Single-repo usage is just a workspace of size 1 — no special-casing.

### 3.5 Knowledge Layer (Repo Wiki)

The wiki is a **persistent, compounding** set of markdown pages that explain *intent, conventions and
gotchas* — the things the graph cannot infer from structure alone. It is the LLM-Wiki pattern
(Karpathy / Microsoft `llmwiki`) but **grounded in the deterministic graph**, which is what makes it
trustworthy rather than drift-prone.

**Page model.** Each page is a markdown file under `.becket/wiki/` with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
id: wiki_order_service
kind: service            # module | service | flow | concept | overview
symbol_ids: [sym_a1b2, sym_c3d4]   # anchors into the deterministic graph
source: mcp_sampling     # deterministic | mcp_sampling
graph_fingerprint: 9f12… # hash of the anchored subgraph at authoring time
see_also: [wiki_billing_client, wiki_payment_flow]
---

## OrderService
Responsibility, invariants, known gotchas, links to flows…
```

- `index.md` is the **router / table of contents** — an agent reads it first, then opens only the
  pages it needs (no vector DB required at small/medium scale; embeddings still available for ranking).
- `symbol_ids` make pages **navigable both ways**: from a symbol you can find its page, and a page can
  resolve to exact code locations.

**Authoring (ingest).** `becket build` never authors prose. Pages are created/updated **lazily via
MCP sampling** the first time an area is queried, or eagerly via `becket wiki sync`. The prompt is
**grounded**: it includes the deterministic facts for the anchored subgraph (symbols, edges, flows,
entrypoints) plus redacted source excerpts, so the model summarizes *real* structure instead of
guessing. Output is cached in the store and written to markdown. Without an MCP host, the layer is
simply absent — the core and JSON artifacts are unaffected.

**Template slots (not free-form wiki).** Page bodies use a fixed skeleton per `kind`. Sections such as
Routes, Callers, Impact, and See-also are **compiled from the graph**; only designated slots (e.g.
`## Intent & gotchas`) are LLM-authored. This avoids becoming a generic LLM Wiki clone where structure
drifts with every edit.

**Claim blocks.** Structural assertions are machine-readable for deterministic lint:

```markdown
<!-- becket:claim calls sym_billing_client source=graph -->
```

Lint compares claims to live edges without parsing natural language.

**Watch-triggered sync.** After `becket build --watch`, pages whose `graph_fingerprint` no longer
matches the anchored subgraph are queued for `wiki sync`. Maintenance is event-driven, not manual.

**Verification (lint).** Because the graph is ground truth, `becket wiki lint` can do what a pure LLM
wiki cannot:
- **Stale detection** — recompute each page's `graph_fingerprint`; if the anchored subgraph changed,
  the page is flagged for re-sync.
- **Contradiction detection** — heuristics + optional sampling compare page claims (e.g. "calls
  BillingClient") against actual edges; mismatches are reported.
- **Orphan / broken links** — pages with no inbound `see_also` and dangling cross-links are surfaced.

Lint runs locally and deterministically for the structural checks; only optional semantic checks use
sampling. Staleness is a first-class state, so the wiki **degrades loudly, never silently**.

**Incrementality.** Wiki staleness is keyed to the same content hashes used by incremental build:
touching a file marks only the pages whose anchored symbols changed, keeping re-sync cheap.

### 3.6 Context Assembly (code + knowledge + impact)

This is the "code in context" surface — the answer to *"give me what I need to fix this bug"* without
dumping the repo. Given a symbol (or domain), a **token budget**, and an optional **task mode**, the
assembler builds a ranked bundle:

| Task mode | Optimized for |
|---|---|
| `fix` | Focused snippets, callers, tests, impact depth ~2 |
| `refactor` | Deep impact, cross-module edges |
| `onboard` | Flow overview + wiki, fewer snippets |

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Q["context(symbol, budget, task)"] --> R["Resolve symbol → graph node"]
    R --> N["Select neighborhood\n(task-specific depth)"]
    N --> RANK["Rank by relevance\n(edge proximity + embedding similarity)"]
    RANK --> SLICE["Slice real source snippets\n(from disk, with line ranges)"]
    R --> W["Attach grounded wiki page(s)"]
    R --> I["Attach impact set + related tests"]
    SLICE --> PACK["Pack to token budget\n(greedy by relevance)"]
    W --> PACK
    I --> PACK
    PACK --> OUT["Context bundle\n(markdown default / JSON)"]
```

- **Code is sliced from the real files on disk** (never model-generated), with `path` + line ranges so
  the agent can open the full file if needed.
- **Budgeting** is greedy by relevance: the most relevant snippet, the symbol's wiki page, and the
  impact set are included first; lower-relevance neighbors fill the remaining budget.
- **Primary output is markdown** (default) — one paste-ready file for agents. `--json` for tooling.
- The bundle is the union of all three layers — *verified structure + meaning + code*.

**Shipped (v0.2):** `becket context` returns markdown with real snippets, sanitized wiki, impact, and greedy packing to `--budget`. Task modes: `fix`, `refactor`, `onboard`.

### Artifact mapping (`.becket/`)
| File | Backed by | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `architecture.json` | MODULE + layer/edge summary | High-level structural map |
| `symbols.json` | SYMBOL | Symbol catalog with locations & FQNs |
| `dependencies.json` | EDGE (imports/calls) | Dependency graph |
| `flows.json` | FLOW + FLOW_STEP | Reconstructed business flows |
| `entrypoints.json` | ENTRYPOINT | Detected entry points |
| `cross_repo.json` | cross-repo EDGE | Workspace service-boundary edges |
| `wiki/index.md` | WIKI_PAGE (router) | Table of contents / page router |
| `wiki/*.md` | WIKI_PAGE | Grounded knowledge pages (frontmatter anchors symbol ids) |

> Every **JSON** artifact embeds `schemaVersion` and is produced deterministically (byte-identical
> rebuilds). Schema changes follow **semantic versioning**; breaking changes bump the major and ship a
> migration note. The `source`/`confidence` fields distinguish deterministic facts from AI-inferred
> enrichment so consumers can trust/weight accordingly.
>
> **Wiki markdown** is the one artifact class that is *model-authored* (via MCP sampling) and therefore
> **not** byte-deterministic. Its frontmatter (`source`, `graph_fingerprint`, `stale`) lets consumers
> tell verified facts from generated prose and detect drift. The deterministic core never depends on
> the wiki; the wiki always depends on (and is verified against) the core.

### Domains & flows: zero-config first (final decision)
Simplicity is a hard requirement: **the tool must work with no configuration file at all.** A domain
(e.g. `payment`) is resolved in this order:

1. **Auto-discovery (default, zero-config):** deterministic signals — module/folder names, call-graph
   clustering, entry-point grouping — plus embedding similarity, propose domains automatically. Names
   are deterministic by default and upgraded to nicer prose lazily via MCP sampling when available.
   `becket build` + `becket flow payment` just works on a fresh repo.
2. **CLI refinement (no hand-written syntax):** if a guess is wrong, the developer fixes it with a
   command, persisted in the store — *not* a config file to author:
   ```
   becket domain rename <auto-id> payment
   becket domain add payment src/billing/** PaymentService
   ```
3. **Optional `becket.toml` (power users only):** a single, tiny, fully-optional file for teams that
   want domain definitions version-controlled. Never required; the tool is fully functional without it.

So: **zero config to start, CLI to refine, optional file only if you want it in Git.** No mandatory or
"strange" configuration.

---

## 5. API Design

Becket is **not** a REST/GraphQL service in v1 — being local-first, its "API" is three coordinated contracts:

### 5.1 CLI contract
Verb-based, scriptable, machine-friendly. Every command supports `--json` for stable structured output and non-zero exit codes on failure.
```
becket build [--incremental] [--no-embeddings] [--watch]
becket impact <symbol>   [--depth N] [--json]
becket flow   <domain>   [--json]
becket context <symbol>  [--budget <tokens>] [--task fix|refactor|onboard] [--json]
becket wiki   sync  [--all]                    # recompile stale pages (structure; prose preserved)
becket wiki   lint  [--json] [--strict]        # stale / claims / links / orphans vs graph
becket wiki   show  <page|symbol>              # print grounded page
becket domain  rename <auto-id> <name>
becket domain  add    <name> <path|symbol>...
```

**Shipped (v0.2):** `build`, `impact`, `flow`, `context` (markdown bundle), `wiki`, `domain`, `workspace build`.

`context` returns code snippets + wiki + impact packed to `--budget`. `wiki sync` recompiles graph structure; prose enrichment via MCP `get_wiki enrich=true`.

### 5.2 MCP contract (primary agent interface)
JSON-RPC 2.0 over **stdio** (local, no open port by default). Tools mirror the README:

| Tool | Input | Output | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `get_impact` | `{ symbol, depth? }` | affected modules, downstream deps, related tests, risk zones | **shipped** |
| `get_flow` | `{ domain }` | end-to-end path, service interactions | **shipped** |
| `get_dependencies` | `{ symbol, depth? }` | direct/transitive dependencies | **shipped** |
| `get_context` | `{ symbol, budget?, task? }` | markdown bundle: snippets + wiki + impact | **shipped** |
| `get_wiki` | `{ page?, enrich? }` | grounded markdown page; `enrich` fills prose via sampling | **shipped** |

The server also declares the **`sampling` client capability**: when enrichment **or wiki authoring**
needs an LLM, it issues a sampling request so the **host agent's model** (e.g. Cursor) runs the
completion — no embedded keys. `get_context` slices real source for snippets; only wiki prose is
model-authored.

### 5.3 Artifact contract
The `.becket/*.json` files are a **read API for any tool**, versioned via `schemaVersion`. This makes Becket consumable even without running its process (CI checks, dashboards, other agents).

**Why this paradigm:** the consumers are local processes and agents on the same machine. stdio MCP +
files give zero network surface, zero auth complexity, and trivial composability. A **local HTTP/gRPC
server is deliberately out of scope for v1** and only revisited if a remote/team mode is approved.

## 6. Infrastructure & Deployment

Because the runtime is the developer's machine, "infrastructure" means **build, packaging, distribution, and CI** — not server hosting.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    PR["Pull Request"] --> CI["CI (GitHub Actions):\nfmt + clippy\n+ unit/integration tests\n+ schema validation\n+ cross-OS matrix"]
    CI --> BENCH["Perf benchmarks\n(small→huge repo fixtures)"]
    CI --> TAG{"Release tag?"}
    TAG -- yes --> REL["cargo-dist:\ncross-compile native binaries\n(macOS/Linux/Windows, x64+arm64)"]
    REL --> SIGN["Sign + SLSA provenance"]
    SIGN --> PUB["Publish:\nGitHub Releases · npm wrapper pkg"]
```

- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, matrix over macOS/Linux/Windows (x64 + arm64). Gates: `cargo fmt`, `clippy`, tests, **JSON Schema validation**, and **determinism tests** (same fixture → byte-identical artifacts). Performance benchmarks guard against latency regressions on large-repo fixtures.
- **Distribution**: signed **native binaries** via `cargo-dist` on GitHub Releases and a **thin npm wrapper** (`npx becket`) that downloads the matching prebuilt binary. Contributors build from a clone; no crates.io publish.
- **Versioning**: release-please / conventional commits; the artifact `schemaVersion` is versioned **independently** from the CLI version.
- **No cloud to operate.** There is **no team-sync, no backend, zero telemetry, and no outbound LLM traffic from Becket** — any LLM call is executed by the host agent via MCP sampling, not by Becket.

---

## 7. Security & Authentication

The asset under protection is **the source code itself** (often the user's most sensitive IP) plus any secrets embedded in it.

**Data handling & privacy**
- **Local-first by construction**: the deterministic core has no network access; nothing leaves the machine.
- **Zero telemetry** — no analytics, no usage collection, no "phone home", ever (per PO directive).
- **`.becketignore`**: excludes paths (e.g. `.env`, vendored dirs) from analysis entirely.
- **Secret redaction**: before *any* LLM interaction (including MCP sampling), run secret-scanning/redaction (API keys, tokens) so secrets are never transmitted.

**AI boundary (the main exfiltration risk)**
- Becket **bundles no LLM and integrates no remote provider** — there is no API key to leak and no outbound LLM call originating from Becket.
- LLM text generation happens **only via MCP sampling**, executed by the host agent (e.g. Cursor) over the existing stdio channel. Becket opens no new connection.
- The bundled embedding model is **local and in-process** (no daemon, no network).
- Before content is handed to a sampling request, **secret-scanning/redaction** runs so secrets are never included.

**Access control**
- **No auth needed**: the trust boundary is the local OS user. MCP runs over **stdio (no listening port)**, so there is no remote attack surface, and there is no network/team component to secure.

**Supply-chain & integrity**
- Signed releases + SLSA provenance; `Cargo.lock` committed + `cargo audit`/`cargo deny` in CI.
- Parsing runs on untrusted code but is **non-executing** (tree-sitter parses, never evaluates), avoiding code-execution risk during analysis.

## 8. Licensing & Open Source

- **License: Apache-2.0.** Permissive (maximizes adoption — essential to the "become the standard like
  Git" goal) and, unlike MIT, includes an **explicit patent grant** protecting users and contributors.
- **Dependency hygiene:** prefer Apache-2.0/MIT/BSD dependencies. **Verify the embedding model's
  license** (e.g. BGE family) is compatible before bundling; otherwise ship it as a separately
  downloaded artifact.
- **Governance (future):** clear `CONTRIBUTING`, a language-plugin contribution guide, and semantic
  versioning of both the CLI and the artifact `schemaVersion` to keep the ecosystem stable.

## 9. Final Decisions (all locked — ready for development)

Every decision below is settled; there are **no open questions** blocking development.

| # | Topic | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Language | **Rust** end-to-end (core, CLI, MCP). |
| 2 | Multi-language | **tree-sitter**, plugin per language. First-class set at launch: **TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, Go, Java, Rust**; more added as plugins. |
| 3 | Scale & latency | Designed for small→huge repos. **Target budgets** (enforced by CI benchmarks): incremental rebuild of a changed file **< 200 ms**; query (`impact`/`flow`/`context`) **p95 < 100 ms** on a warm index; cold full build streamed with progress. |
| 4 | Storage | **SQLite** (`rusqlite`) + recursive CTEs; **`sqlite-vec`** for vectors; single embedded file. |
| 5 | Embeddings | One **bundled local ONNX model** (BGE-small class, ~100 MB), downloaded on first build & cached. In-process, offline, deterministic. `--no-embeddings` opt-out. |
| 6 | LLM enrichment | **Host-delegated via MCP sampling only** (Cursor/Claude Code/Codex). **No bundled LLM, no Ollama, no remote provider, no keys.** Lazy + cached; build never needs a model. |
| 7 | Multi-repo | **First-class workspace** model; cross-repo linking via service contracts (HTTP/gRPC/proto/OpenAPI/queues/shared libs). Single-repo = workspace of 1. |
| 8 | Workspace discovery | **Auto-detect** git repos under the working root (zero-config); optional `becket.toml` to override — never required. |
| 9 | Domains/flows | **Zero-config auto-discovery** by default; refine via **CLI commands** (persisted in store); optional tiny `becket.toml` only for version-controlled definitions. |
| 10 | Cross-service | **Static + heuristic + AI inference**, edges tagged with `confidence`. No runtime tracing in v1. |
| 11 | Telemetry | **Zero. None. Ever.** |
| 12 | Cloud / team | **None** — strictly local. |
| 13 | License | **Apache-2.0**; dependencies & embedding model kept license-compatible. |
| 14 | Distribution | **npm wrapper** (`npx becket`) as primary channel; signed GitHub Release binaries (`cargo-dist`) and shell installer as fallback. No crates.io. |
| 15 | Platforms | **macOS & Linux tier-1** (x64 + arm64, fully CI-tested); **Windows tier-2** (supported & CI-built, issues triaged after tier-1). |
| 16 | Artifact schema | JSON Schema with `schemaVersion`, SemVer'd independently from the CLI. |
| 17 | Knowledge model | **Three layers**: Deterministic Core (ground truth) → grounded **Repo Wiki** (markdown, MCP-authored, lazy) → **Context Assembly** (code + wiki + impact, budgeted). The graph **grounds and lints** the wiki. **Wiki-only is out of scope.** |
| 18 | Context output | `get_context` / `becket context` return **real code snippets** + grounded wiki + impact within a token budget. Code is never model-generated. |
| 19 | Adoption-first delivery | One markdown bundle per task (`--task fix\|refactor\|onboard`). Host agent orchestrates; **no RLM in core** (ADR-0007). |

**v1.1 scope note (additive):** decisions #17–#18 extend, but do not alter, the locked core (#1–#16).
The Deterministic Core, its determinism guarantees, the "no bundled LLM / MCP-sampling-only" rule, and
the local-first/zero-telemetry posture are unchanged. The wiki and context-assembly layers are
strictly additive: with no MCP host they are absent and the core behaves exactly as in v1.0.

This document is the **agreed source of truth**. Implementation can begin against it.
